<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Species name:</strong> <em>Nypa fruticans</em> <strong>Kingdom:</strong> Plantae <strong>Phylum:</strong> Tracheophyta <a href="https://www.gbif.org/species/2738422">GBIF</a></p>
<p><strong>Brief Description of the Species:</strong><br />
<em>Nypa fruticans</em> is a palm found in the upstream estuarine zone in all intertidal regions. It forms extensive belts along brackish to tidal freshwater creeks and rivers. It is very fast growing, especially in fresh water, and is a competitive species (<a href="http://eol.org/pages/1137487/details" class="uri">http://eol.org/pages/1137487/details</a>). It is the only palm adpted to the mangrove biome and grows in terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p><em>Nypa fruticans</em> is used for a wide range of commercial goods and services including- thatching and for making alcoholic drinks through a fermentation process(<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0" class="uri">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0</a>). It is an important emerging source of biofuel, capable of producing ethanol ranging from 6,480 to 20,000 L/ha, a higher yeild than sugarcane(<a href="http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=MY2015000742" class="uri">http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=MY2015000742</a>). It is considered to be of ’Least concern’as it is widespread and locally common (<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0" class="uri">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Known Distribution of the Species</strong><br />
<em>Nypa fruticans</em> ranges from Sri Lanka and the Ganges Delta through to the west Pacific. In South and South-East Asia it is found in Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam . In much of its native range it has been planted and exists in large or small-scale plantations (<a href="http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview" class="uri">http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview</a>).</p>
<p><em>Nypa fruticans</em> has been introduced to Cameroon and Nigeria in West Africa and to Panama in Central America and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean. (<a href="http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview" class="uri">http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview</a>).</p>

<h1>Scientific Research on the Species</h1>
<p><strong>Research categories</strong><br />
Much of the research on <em>Clarias macrocephalus</em> is categorised as Fisheries (20), Marine and Freshwater Biology (15), and Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology (4).</p>
<p><strong>Research summary</strong><br />
<em>Clarias macrocephalus</em> is an economically important fish in Thailand and is increasingly being cultivated in aquaculture settings(10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.08.001). However <em>C. macrocephalus</em> doesn’t cultivate well and also has a near threatened status across its wild population range because of habitat loss; as such much of the research effort is at identifying ways to increase production in aquaculture and minimise harm to the wild population.</p>
<p>A genetic population study examined the success of crosses between males of various strains of the fast growing African catfish <em>C. gariepinus</em> and females of strains of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> - which has tastier flesh - and found some hybrid strains had greater absolute growth rate than others (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.12.023). The use of hybrids has led to some conservation concerns in Thailand regarding the wild population of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> becoming back crossed with artificially created hybrids that have escaped from cultured systems. A study in Thailand took DNA samples from 25 natural populations of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> from across the country - they found 12 of the populations contained alleles in them from the African <em>C. gariepinus</em>(10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.08.001). The hybrid is able to breed with both species which could lead to species extinction and also grows faster than <em>C. macrocephalus</em> and so might out-compete the native stock for resources (Na-Nakorn 2004).</p>
<p>Hara, M. et al., 1998, examined genetic distance in 4 wild populations in Thailand, they found two population groups, which were Chiangrai-Prachinburi and Pattani-Yala group and genetic distance was larger within the first group than those within the second group.</p>
<p>Much of the research literature is focussed on maximising yield in aquaculture settings through studying immunity to pathogens, as well as factors affecting growth and reproduction. Bacterial infection by <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em> increased expression of the gene ‘HSC70-2’ in the tissues of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> which may relate to the role of HSC70-2 in the immune response of the species (10.1111/are.12076). Poompuang, S. et al 2012 found the C3 protein produced in the liver of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> had an essential role in immunity – furthermore an increase in C3 was induced by beta glucan in the diet of the fish.</p>
<p>The effect of stocking densities in aquacultures was investigated and found to be density dependent - <em>C. macrocephalus</em> fry reared at 285 m(-3) in tanks and at 114 m(-3) in ponds had significantly faster growth rates than fish reared at higher densities (10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00763.x). Myostatin levels were found to have a negtaive feedback effect, rising levels reducing growth rate in larvae of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> when they were fasted for a period of time (10.1007/s10695-014-0015-8).</p>
<p>Methods of increasing reproduction, whilst minimising numbers of broodstock were investigated in the literature - as numbers of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> are limited. One study examined 5 forms of Gonadotropin releasing hormones to see the efficacy at stimulating ovulation in <em>C. macrocephalus</em>. Chicken GnRH was most effective as identical to catfish Gn RH (10.1016/0167-0115(92)90024-O). Another study looked at the success of usig irradiated sperm of another fish species for gynogenesis - creating offspring with only the mothers DNA (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.02.032 ). Another study examined the properties required to create artificial seminal plasma to be able to dilute <em>C. macrocephalus</em> milt whilst still giving high fertilisation success of eggs -so less males are sacrificed during artifical insemination (10.1016/S0044-8486(98)00402-5). <em>Clarias macrocephalus</em>, harvested from irrigated rice fields in Malaysia, showed that speawing changes with water level (10.1007/BF00014311).</p>
<p>What to feed <em>Clarias macrocephalus</em> in culture was looked at by Bolivar, M. and Fermin, AC., 1996, who found that catfish larvae can be given a dry diet, but growth rate is higher if live feed - artemia - is given prior to the dry formula diet.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatic or marine?</strong><br />
In a sector review of aquaculture in Thailand by the FAO <em>Clarias macrocephalus</em> and its hybrid with <em>C. gariepinus</em> are listed as freshwater species, not listed within the commercial brackishwater production section of the report. [There has been some discussion of the possibility of introducing some catfish species] (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Clay/publication/313167412_Preliminary_observations_on_salinity_tolerance_of_Clarias_lazera_from_Israel/links/58d73761aca2727e5ee94ab6/Preliminary-observations-on-salinity-tolerance-of-Clarias-lazera-from-Israel.pdf" class="uri">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Clay/publication/313167412_Preliminary_observations_on_salinity_tolerance_of_Clarias_lazera_from_Israel/links/58d73761aca2727e5ee94ab6/Preliminary-observations-on-salinity-tolerance-of-Clarias-lazera-from-Israel.pdf</a>) into brackishwater aquaculture to make use of available coastal locations, but I didn’t find any reference to this having occured for this species.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a description of any research locations that you can identify?</strong></p>
<p>A conservation biology study in Thailand took DNA samples from 25 natural populations of <em>C. macrocephalus</em> from across the country including- 12 populations from provinces located in the Chaophraya river basin in the center of the country, 5 from the Mekong river basin, 1 from the east and 7 from the south of Thailand - they found 12 of the populations contained alleles in them from the African <em>C. gariepinus</em>(10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.08.001). Another genetic study in Thailand OF <em>C. macrocephalus</em>, by Hara, M. et al in 1998, assayed 14 proteins across 4 wild populations from the north (Chiangrai), central (Prachinburi) and south (Pattani and Yala) of Thailand.</p>
<p>In 1987, <em>C. macrocephalus</em> were sampled monthly from the rice fields, sump ponds and irrigation canals of North Kerian area up to about the latitude 5°45’, Northwestern Peninsular Malaysia the fish are considered as one population 10.1007/BF00014311.</p>

<div id="patent-activity" class="section level1">
<h1>Patent activity</h1>
<p>There are only 2 patents for <em>C. macrocephalus</em>, the most commonly cited <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/WO_2008_084074_A2">patent being for a specialized feed for sensitive organisms, especially larvae or juvenile forms of farmed aquatic organisms and the method of producing the feed.</a>.</p>
<p>The other <em>C. macrocephalus</em> <a href="https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/WO_2009_063044_A1">patent is for the use of vitamin K3 for treatment of parasitic disease in an individual, such as an animal or human being. Vitamin K3 has been found to be effective in the treatment of fish suffering from parasite infestation</a>.</p>
