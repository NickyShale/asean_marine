# Overview

**Species name:** *Nypa fruticans* 
**Kingdom:** Plantae 
**Phylum:** Tracheophyta [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/2738422)
  
**Brief Description of the Species:**  
*Nypa fruticans* is a palm found in the upstream estuarine zone in all intertidal regions. It forms extensive belts along brackish to tidal freshwater creeks and rivers. It is very fast growing, especially in fresh water, and is a competitive species (http://eol.org/pages/1137487/details). It is the only palm adpted to the mangrove biome and grows in terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats.

The trunk of *Nypa fruticans* grows underground with the leaves, female flower inflorences and male flowers visible above the ground (http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=220009317).

*Nypa fruticans* is used for a wide range of commercial goods and services including- thatching and for making alcoholic drinks through a fermentation process(http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0). It is an important emerging source of biofuel,  capable of producing ethanol ranging from 6,480 to 20,000 L/ha, a higher yeild than sugarcane(http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=MY2015000742). It is considered to be of 'Least concern'as it is widespread and locally common (http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0).

**Known Distribution of the Species**  
*Nypa fruticans* ranges from Sri Lanka and the Ganges Delta through to the west Pacific. In South and South-East Asia it is found in Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam . In much of its native range it has been planted and exists in large or small-scale plantations (http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview).

*Nypa fruticans* has been introduced to Cameroon and Nigeria in West Africa and to Panama in Central America and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean.  (http://eol.org/pages/1137487/overview).

**First description**  
[*Nypa fruticans* was first described by a German botanist called Christoph Carl Friedrich von Wurmb in 1781](https://www.gbif.org/species/2738422). 

# Scientific Research on the Species 

**Research categories**  
Much of the research on *Nypa fruticans*  is categorised as Environmental Sciences (8), Biology (6), Marine and Freshwater Biology (6), and Plant Sciences (6).   

**Research summary**  
Much of the research on *Nypa fruticans* is studying its role within mangrove biomes, an important ecological and economic habitat type. In the Segara Anakan lagoon, Java, mangrove tree density and diversity was examined at the eastern part of the lake -  *Nypa fruticans* was present and characterised a mature undisturbed forest (10.1007/s10113-008-0074-4). Within Malaysia - on Carey Island - a similar demongraphic study was conducted looking at the percentage of *Nypa fruticans* seedling, juvenile, adult and mature present the population showed a majority of adults with 67.9% (Aslezaeim, N. and Rozainah, MZ. 2010). Also in Malaysia a study of forest structure, diversity index and above-ground biomass was conducted on *N.fruticans* at Tok Bali mangrove forest, Kelantan (Kamaruzaman, J et al 2007).

Low genetic diversity for *N.fruticans* was found amongst six natural populations from China, Vietnam, and Thailand across a total of 183 individuals (10.1016/j.aquabot.2009.09.003). Creating *N.fruticans* seedlings was the focus of some research due to the economic benefits of the plant - mass clonal propagation of disease free planting materials was successfuly trialled in one study (Abad, R G et al 2015). In another propagation study in Vietnam, a participatory action research methodology was used to successfully establish an *N.fruticans* (and other mangrove species) nursery on unused acid sulphate soil -normally considered unsuitable for mangrove growth (Nguyen, T P 2016).

Species living on *N.fruticans* or within the mangrove biome it creates were the focus some of the literature with several studies examining the fungi present on samples from different populations. One study tested the fungi growing on *N.fruticans* for heavy metal tolerance and found that one that was able to successfully grow depsit heavy metal pollution - menaing it could potentially be used as a atype of biosorbent materal (10.1007/s12601-015-0040-2). Species diversity of marine fungi on *Nypa fruticans* in Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand were investigated, with 81 fungal taxa recorded (10.1515/BOT.2005.049). Taxonomy of fungus found on *Nypa fruticans* in the intertidal regions in Trang and Trat provinces, Thailand was examined in another study (10.7872/crym/v36.iss3.2015.319). Biodiversity and ecology of higher filamentous fungi on *Nypa fruticans* along the Tutong River, Brunei were examined during 1999, with Forty-six taxa recorded (Hyde, K.D.and Sarma, V.V. 2006).

Both mudskippers and fireflies were found to inhabit populations of *Nypa fruticans* within the literature. Mudskippers, *Periophthalmodon septemradiatus* were recorded for the first time in Peninsular Malaysia, from the small tributaries of the rivers Selangor and Muar (Khaironizam, MZ and Norma-Rashid, Y. 2003). Whereas *Pteroptyx* fireflies are commonly reported to congregate in large numbers in mangroves, but researchers found they preferred vegetation consisting mainly of *S. caseolaris* and *N.fruticans* (10.1007/s11273-009-9172-4). A study of the root-associating bacteria of *N.fruticans* found in brackish-water mud in Sarawak, Malaysia, discovered that *Burkholderia vietnamiensis* to be its main nitrogen-fixing bacterium (10.1271/bbb.100397). Another important type of organism examined in the literature was that of the pollinators inhabiting *N.fruticans* mangroves in an Oxford University study, within the submerged Melaleuca forests of Vietnam (Nguyen, Q. 2008).

The economic exploitation of *N.fruticans* was examined by some researchers, one Malaysian paper looked at the ripe and unripe fruit content to see if can be used as a food source (10.1051/fruits/2013089). Whilst another scientist examined the potential of *N.fruticans* in the Philippines for alcohol production (Rasco, E.T., 2010).


**Aquatic or marine?**  
It grows in mangrove forests in upwater estuarine locations, so it is aquatic, and terrestrial  - as it is exposed at low tide, and marine as the saltwater from the ocean meets the freshwater of the rivers (http://eol.org/pages/1137487/details).

**Is there a description of any research locations that you can identify?**  
A demographic study of *Nypa fruticans* was undertaken on Carey Island Malaysia (Aslezaeim, N.and Rozainah, M.Z., 2010). Forest structure was also examined at Tok Bali mangrove forest, Kelantan, Malaysia Kamaruzaman (Kamaruzaman, J. et al. 2007).A study looking at tree density and diversity of mangroves in different areas of Segara Anakan lagoon, Java, noted the presence of *N.fruticans* as an indicator of a mature forest(10.1007/s10113-008-0074-4). 

In the Vam Ray area Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, a participatory research methodology was used to establish a mangrove nursery on soil considered previously to be unsuitable - 5 types of mangrove species were successfully grown grown including *Nypa fruticans* seedlings (Nguyen, T.P., 2016); providing a potential source of income for local people.

Genetic diversity of populations from six natural populations of *Nypa fruticans* from China, Vietnam, and Thailand was assessed, and showed an extremely low level of genetic diversity (10.1016/j.aquabot.2009.09.003).

Selangor and Muar rivers of Malaysia were discoverd to contain mudskipper populations, whilst a 2010 study of alcohol production potential took place in Vinzons, Camarines Norte, Philippines(Rasco, E.T., 2010). Pollinators of *Nypa fruticans* were examined in the submerged meleuca forests of South Vietnam (Nguyen, Q. 2008) and the bacteria inhabiting the rhizomes of *Nypa fruticans* in Sarawak Malaysia were identifed (10.1271/bbb.100397).
