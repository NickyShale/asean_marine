It is an important emerging source of biofuel,  capable of producing ethanol ranging from 6,480 to 20,000 L/ha, a higher yeild than sugarcane(http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=MY2015000742). It is considered to be of 'Least concern'as it is widespread and locally common (http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178800/0).
