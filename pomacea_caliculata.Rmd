# Overview

**Species name:** *Pomacea canaliculata*
**Kingdom:** Animalia
**Phylum:** Mollusca [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/2292582)
  
**Brief Description of the Species:**  
*Pomacea canaliculata* is a freshwater snail with a voracious appetite for water plants including lotus, water chestnut, taro and rice. Introduced widely from its native South America by the aquarium trade and as a source of human food, it is now a major crop pest in south east Asia (primarily in rice) and Hawaii (taro) and poses a serious threat to many wetlands around the world through potential habitat modification and competition with native species. A highly generalist and voracious macrophytophagous herbivore. Most plants are eaten (http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=135). 

The activity rate of *Pomacea canaliculata* varies highly with the water temperature. At 18°C they hardly move around, whilst the opposite is true at higher temperatures e.g. 25°C (The (http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=135).

Females lay clusters of bright pink eggs attached to solid surfaces and reproductive output can be enormous with cutch sizes of up to 1000, but averages are probably 200-300. Clutches are laid every few weeks (http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=135).

**Known Distribution of the Species**  
*P. canaliculata* is native from Argentina to the Amazon basin, as well as being introduced to most of southern, eastern, and southeast Asia and the southern part of the United States (http://eol.org/pages/467346/overview). *P. canaliculata* is widely distributed in lakes, ponds and swamps throughout its native range of the Amazon Inferior Basin and the Plata Basin (http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=135).

Biogeographic Regions: nearctic (Introduced ); oriental (Introduced ); neotropical (Native); oceanic islands (Introduced )(http://eol.org/pages/467346/overview).

**First description**  
 The French Biologist Jean Baptiste Lamarck first described *P. canaliculata* in the natural history of invertebartes in 1822 (https://www.gbif.org/species/2292582).
