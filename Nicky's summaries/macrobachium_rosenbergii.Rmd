# Overview

**Species name:** *Macrobachium rosenbergii*  
**Kingdom:** Animalia    
**Phylum:** Arthropoda [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/2224546) 
  
**Brief Description of the Species:**  
*Macrobachium rosenbergii* known as the Giant River Prawn and the Giant Freshwater Prawn - it is widely fished and also is the main freshwater shrimp cultivated within the commercial aquaculture industry, [IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/197873/0). The body length of this large prawn species is 320 mm for males; and 250 mm for females, as it is a sexually dimporphic species. [FAO.org](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Macrobrachium_rosenbergii/en).

Global production of the Giant River Prawn has grown since its inception in the 1970's and by 2002 was 200 000 tonnes/yr [FAO.org](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Macrobrachium_rosenbergii/en).
  
**Known Distribution of the Species**  
*M. rosenbergii* is native to Bangladesh; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; China; India; Indonesia (Jawa); Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak); Myanmar (Myanmar (mainland)); Pakistan; Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand [IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/197873/0). The geographic distribution is now much wider than this as it has been introduced to all contintents for aquaculture and is now found in Brazil, Venezuela, Australia, United States, Iceland, Japan, Germany, Iran, Taiwan,[GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/2224546).
  
**First description**  
*M. rosenbergii* was first described by Johannes De Man in 1879 as Palaemon rosenbergii in the publication: De Man, 1879, Notes Leyden Mus., 1:167, however in 1966 Johnson renamed it to its current nomenclature of *Macrobachium rosenbergii* [(Holthuis,L.B. 1980)](http://www.fao.org/fi/oldsite/eims_search/advanced_s_result.asp?JOB_NO=AC477).

# Scientific Research on the Species  
  
**Research categories**  
Much of the research on *M. Rosenbergii* is categorised as fisheries (77), followed by Marine and Freshwater Biology (46), Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (21), Veterinary Sciences (20), Zoology (13), Immunology (12) amongst others.
  
**Research summary**  
The majority of the research effort on *Macrobachium rosenbergii* is directed towards maximising aquaculture yield to increase economic gain of shrimp farmers. So the research is broadly concerned with disease prevention/treatment, nutrition, stocking densities, reproductive success, and genetic make up of broodstock. Understanding the diseases of *M.rosenbergii* - such as *L. garvieae* a bacteria that infects shrimps (Dangwetngam, M. and Suanyuk, N. 2014), and White Tail Disease virus (10.1016/j.jip.2010.09.007) which causes largescale mortality in aquaculture populations- can enable treatments and preventative strategies to be adopted. Improving yield of shrimp farmers has led many to look to the genetic quality of broodstock - analysing the parentage of existing broodstock (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.10.045), as well as comparing this with wild samples (10.1016/j.bse.2014.12.023).This genetic analysis can then help develop a more successful breeding startegy (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.12.011). 
The nutirional composition of feed given to farmed *M.rosenbergii* is another common theme of research in the literature, as well fed shrimps grow bigger and reproduction is increased (10.7717/peerj.2735). However for shrimp farmers in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, identifying non commercial feed options - due to affordabilty issues- is key (10.1111/j.1444-2906.2005.00961.x). Understanding how eyestalks inhibit reproduction in female *M.rosenbergii* (10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2014.40.157), as well as understanding how sex differentiation occurs (10.3390/ijms17050690) and when to intervene to create all male stock (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.03.015) are some of the reproductive focussed areas of research covered in the literature.

**Aquatic or marine?** 
Although *M. rosenbergii* is predominantly a tropical freshwater species, the larval stage of the species is found within adjacent brackish water, as females migrate to estauries to lay their eggs [FAO.org](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Macrobrachium_rosenbergii/en).Most of the *M. rosenbergii* farms are in freshwater inland locations, however some are in estuarine and coastal locations where salinity in the ponds can fluctuate and effect breeding success of females (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.04.035).
  
**Is there a description of any research locations that you can identify?**  
Much of the research involves laboratory bred cultures of *M.rosenbergii*, although some studies do include wild samples as is the case in a genetic study by Schneider et al 2013 910.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03147.x). Schneiders' study used cultured prawn samples from: Andhra Pradesh, India; Kaneohe, Hawaii, USA; Tamashiro Market, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA; University of Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel;Frankfort, Kentucky, USA; Leland, Mississippi, USA; Weatherford, Texas, USA as well as wild prawn samples from Hmaw River, Hlaing River and the Pan Hlaing River - tributaries of the Yangon River, Yangon, Myanmar; and Mahanadi River, Orissa, India. There are some references to more specific locations for wild samples within the literature - such as research into a breeding strategy for genetic improvement using wild strains Vietnam (Dong Nai and Mekong) (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.12.011)(10.1111/jwas.12148).*L. garvieae* was isolated from *M.rosenbergii* samples taken from cultures and wild prawns from the Phatthalung and Songkhla, provinces of southern Thailand (Dangwetngam, M. and Suanyuk, N., 2014).
Some research doesn't specify anything more than the country such as in a study detailing culture technology in Thailand (10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.03037.x). Genetic diversity analysis was undertaken on cultured samples from farms in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, China, as well as wild samples from Dong Nai River and Mekong River, Vietnam (10.1016/j.bse.2014.12.023).
  
# Patent activity
  
The top cited patent involving *M.Rosenbergii* is regarding [feed composition for shrimps in aquaculture settings](https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/WO_2008_084074_A2). The invention specifies a range of percentage compositions of lipid:carbohydrate:protein, differing nutritional sources, particle size and types - as an alternative to live feed for shrimp larvae. 

The largest family number of a patent associated with *M.Rosenbergii* is for another type of feed, this time for [preparation and use of methionylmethionine as a feed additive for fish And crustaceans] (https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/US_2010_0098801_A1).
