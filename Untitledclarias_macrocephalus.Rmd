# Overview

**Species name:** *Clarias macrocephalus*
**Kingdom:** Animalia   
**Phylum:** Chordata [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/4285694)
  
**Brief Description of the Species:**  
Lives in lowland wetlands and rivers - occurs in shallow, open water and is capable of lying buried in mud for lengthy period if ponds and lakes evaporate during dry seasons (Ref. 9987). Can move out of the water using its extended fins (Ref. 9987). Found in medium to large-sized rivers, stagnant water bodies including sluggish flowing canals and flooded fields of the Mekong (Ref. 12975). Spawns in small streams (Ref. 9987).
  
**Known Distribution of the Species**  
[*O. niloticus* has been taken from its native African and Israeli habitats to tropical and subtropical waters all over the world for aquaculture. Nile tilapia from Japan were introduced to Thailand in 1965, and from Thailand they were sent to the Philippines. Nile tilapia from Cote d'Ivoire were introduced to Brazil in 1971, and from Brazil they were sent to the United States in 1974. In 1978, Nile tilapia was introduced to China, which leads the world in tilapia production and consistently produced more than half of the global production in every year from 1992 to 2003](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Oreochromis_niloticus/en).

**First description**  
*Oreochromis niloticus* was first described by [Linnaeus in 1758 who named it Perca nilotica, this was changed to the current name by Greenwood, P. H. 1960] in his publication which revised the Lake Victoria Haplochromis species (https://www.gbif.org/species/4285694). 

# Scientific Research on the Species 

**Research categories**  
Much of the research on *Oreochromis niloticus* is categorised as Fisheries (78), Marine and Freshwater Biology (61), Veterinary Sciences (14),  Agriculture, Dairy and Animal Science (11).   
**Research summary**  
The research literature on *Oreochromis niloticus* is largely concerned with improving productivity of the aquaculture industry that grows tilapia commercially. Methods of aquaculture are investigated: such as factors effecting rice polyculture, brackishwater aquaculture and cage aquaculture. Rice polyculture involving the farming of *Oreochromis niloticus* amongst other fish species in paddy fields (10.1016/S0044-8486(02)00005-4) has several elements for investigation including rice seeding rate (10.1016/S0044-8486(98)00396-2), nitrogen cycling (10.1007/s10705-007-9106-6) and the ecological/economic benefits of this form of polyculture.

Brackishwater aquaculture requires salinity tolerance, which is not a feature of *Oreochromis niloticus* - it is the least salt tolerant tilapia, but has a quick growth rate. *O.niloticus* is increasingly being cultured in coastal ponds (especially in the Phillipines, Indonesia and Vietnam) - sometimes with shrimps - so it would be beneficial if a more salt tolerant hybrid could be produced (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.02.008).

Stocking density of *O.niloticus* in cages was investigated by the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand (10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01377-4). The combined net yield of both caged and open-pond tilapia was found to be highest in the treatment with 50 fish m(-3).

The feed used in the aquaculture of *O.niloticus* is the focus of much research effort, including the replacement of fish oil with vegetable oil (10.1007/s11745-007-3057-1) - which gave worse yields, however using cheap farm waste -mushroom stalks -to replace rice bran in feeds gave a greateryield for less money (Bahari, I. te al 2014). Scientists supplementing *O.niloticus* feed with antimicrobial herbal extracts found no mortality in S. agalactiae infected Nile tilapia for fish receiving dried matter of A. paniculata aqueous extract supplemented feeds at ratios (w/w) of 4:36 and 5:35 ((10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.01.024). Probiotic supplemented feeds were found to increase survival in *O.niloticus* infected with *Aeromonas hydrophila* (Areechon, N. et al 2016).

Infections of fish with pathogens in intensively farmed aquaculture environments can lead to mass mortality and economic loss, hence much of the literature is concerned with understanding pathogens, and methods of combatting losses. Intensive *O.niloticus*  egg incubation creates conditions favourable for microbe growth leading to mass mortalities of fish larvae (Jantrakajorn, S. and Wongtavatchai, J. 2015). Scientists studied the immune response of *O.niloticus* to better understand how to develop vaccines (Bunyatratchata, W. et al 2015). Occurrence of infections in cultured populations of *O.niloticus* are studied to better understand the disease as was the case with a population infected with Neoechinorhynchus in the Phillipines (Paller, V and de la Cruz C 2012 ).

Heavy metal contamination of watercourses containing farmed *O.niloticus* is a concern in the literature due to heavy industry waste being released, an dthe potential resultant build up in the flesh of farmed fish eaten by local people (10.1016/j.proenv.2015.10.057 selangor)(10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01939.x). Reduction of copper-induced tissue changes in *O.niloticus* by calcium exposure is beneficial in reducing effects in marine species(10.1080/15376510903173674).

Many *O.niloticus* farmers produce all-male populations because of the superior growth rate of males compared to females. The literature discussed different methods for achieveing this such as hormonal sex reversal(Guerrero, R.D. 2008), as well as genetic manipulation to create YY male broodstock achieving a 95.6% male sex ratio in the population(10.1139/cjfas-54-2-396).

Understanding the genetic make up of different breeds of *O.niloticus* (10.1508/cytologia.78.9), and selective breeding using different strains to genetically improve broodstock - is the focus of some reserachers (10.1016/S0044-8486(97)00230-5).Red Tilapia a strain of *O.niloticus* bred for its white flesh is a popular strain for culture.

**Aquatic or marine?**  

Native to the nile basin rivers and lakes in Africa and coastal rivers of Israel] *O.niloticus* is primarily a freshwater fish(http://eol.org/pages/356343/data?toc_id=4#1448). However brackishwater aquaculture is on the rise in Phillipines, Indonesia and Vietnam which culture *O.niloticus* - which requires salinity tolerance - not a strength of *Oreochromis niloticus*, as it is the least salt tolerant cichlid fish, but has a quick growth rate; research is being conducted to breed a more salt tolerant hybrid of *Oreochromis niloticus* (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.02.008).

**Is there a description of any research locations that you can identify?**  
*O.niloticus* is farmed in its native african countries, and Israel but has also been exported for aquaculture in fresh and brackish water locations across the world including: Egypt, Thailand, Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

Some more specific locations are mentioned in the literature such as a study sampling the fish pathogen *Aeromonas hydrophila* occurrence in the *O.niloticus* population in West Bay of Laguna de Bay, Barangay Bayanan, Muntinlupa City, Malaysia in three months during 2005 (Cabrera E. et al. 2006), similarly another study smapled a population in Sampaloc Lake, Phillipinnes for the occurence of a fish pathogen called 'Neoechinorhynchus'(Paller, V. and De la Cruz, C. 2012).Polyculture of *O.niloticus* with 'bleeker' was the focus of a study in the Mekong delta Vietnam. Heavy metal incidence was investigated in two seperate studies in Indonesia one sampling the Galas River & Beranang mining pool, Selangor(10.1016/j.proenv.2015.10.057); and another sampling Lake Cirata, West Java(10.1196/annals.1454.037). Nitrogen cycling in rice fish culture in Bangladesh, was the subject of a study (10.1007/s10705-007-9106-6).Spawning season was studied in two lakes in the Cote d'Ivoire (10.1023/A:100758801082). The spatio-temporal dynamics of fish larvae in Sirindhron Reservoir, Lower Mekong Basin, north-east Thailand (10.21077/ijf.2016.63.3.54491-02).
