# Overview

**Species name:** *Oreochromis niloticus*
**Kingdom:** Animalia   
**Phylum:** Chordata [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/4285694)
  
**Brief Description of the Species:**  
[*Oreochromis niloticus*](http://eol.org/pages/356343/overview) is a species of Tilapia, a cichlid fish [native to the nile basin in Africa and coastal rivers of Israel](http://eol.org/pages/356343/data?toc_id=4#1448), however it's an economically important species of fish which has been introduced widely outside of its natural range.

*O. niloticus* Adults grow to 60cm and live up to 9 years weighing up to 4.3kg. It lives in freshwater and can tolerate brackish water, wit a temperature range of 8-42Â°C.It's an omnivore feeding on plankton as well as mosquito larvae.Groups of cichlids establish social hierarchies in which dominant males have priority for access to mate and food.

Commercial aquaculture of *O. niloticus* dates back to ancient Egypt, as they are fast growing and produce good fillets. The wild type of *O. niloticus* is less popular today as the meat is dark so a lighter meat varriety is used in aquaculture.
  
**Known Distribution of the Species**  
[*O. niloticus* has been taken from its native African and Israeli habitats to tropical and subtropical waters all over the world for aquaculture. Nile tilapia from Japan were introduced to Thailand in 1965, and from Thailand they were sent to the Philippines. Nile tilapia from Cote d'Ivoire were introduced to Brazil in 1971, and from Brazil they were sent to the United States in 1974. In 1978, Nile tilapia was introduced to China, which leads the world in tilapia production and consistently produced more than half of the global production in every year from 1992 to 2003](http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Oreochromis_niloticus/en).

**First description**  
*Oreochromis niloticus* was first described by [Linnaeus in 1758 who named it Perca nilotica, this was changed to the current name by Greenwood, P. H. 1960] in his publication which revised the Lake Victoria Haplochromis species (https://www.gbif.org/species/4285694). 

# Scientific Research on the Species 

**Research categories**  
Much of the research on *Oreochromis niloticus* is categorised as Fisheries (78), Marine and Freshwater Biology (61), Veterinary Sciences (14),  Agriculture, Dairy and Animal Science (11).   
**Research summary**  
The research literature on *Oreochromis niloticus* is largely concerned with improving productivity of the aquaculture industry that grows tilapia commercially. Methods of aquaculture are investigated: such as factors effecting rice polyculture, brackishwater aquaculture and cage aquaculture. Rice polyculture involving the farming of *Oreochromis niloticus* amongst other fish species in paddy fields (10.1016/S0044-8486(02)00005-4) has several elements for investigation including rice seeding rate (10.1016/S0044-8486(98)00396-2), nitrogen cycling (10.1007/s10705-007-9106-6) and the ecological/economic benefits of this form of polyculture.

Brackishwater aquaculture requires salinity tolerance, which is not a feature of *Oreochromis niloticus* - it is the least salt tolerant tilapia, but has a quick growth rate. *O.niloticus* is increasingly being cultured in coastal ponds (especially in the Phillipines, Indonesia and Vietnam) - sometimes with shrimps - so it would be good if a more salt tolerant hybrid could be produced (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.02.008).

Stocking density of *O.niloticus* in cages was investigated by the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand (10.1016/S0044-8486(96)01377-4). The combined net yield of both caged and open-pond tilapia was found to be highest in the treatment with 50 fish m(-3).

The feed used in the aquaculture of *O.niloticus* is the focus of much research effort, including the replacement of fish oil with vegetable oil (10.1007/s11745-007-3057-1) - with worse yields, to using cheap farm waste of mushroom stalks to replace rice bran in feeds - to great success (Bahari, I. te al 2014). Scientists supplementing *O.niloticus* feed with antimicrobial herbal extracts found no mortality in S. agalactiae infected Nile tilapia for fish receiving dried matter of A. paniculata aqueous extract supplemented feeds at ratios (w/w) of 4:36 and 5:35 ((10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.01.024). Probiotic supplemented feeds were found to increase survival in *O.niloticus* infected with *Aeromonas hydrophila* (Areechon, N. et al 2016).

Infections of fish with pathogens in intensively farmed aqauculture environments can lead to mass mortality and economic loss, hence much of the literature is concerned with understanding pathogens, and methods of combatting losses. Scientists studied the immune response of *O.niloticus* to better understand how to develop vaccines (Bunyatratchata, W. et al 2015). Intensive *O.niloticus*  egge incubation creates conditions favourable for microbe growth leading to 

**Aquatic or marine?**  

**Is there a description of any research locations that you can identify?**  
Much of the research referencing specific locations for *V.harveyi* is from investigations into the cause of aquaculture shrimp mortalities as was the case in pond-cultured Penaeus monodon in the provinces of Bohol, Misamis Occidental, Lanao del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines (Inui, Y. et al., 2003).
